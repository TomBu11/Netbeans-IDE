"For he's the master criminal who can defy the law\n" +
"He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair\n" +
"For when they reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!\n" +
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity\n" +
"He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity\n" +
"His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare\n" +
"And when you reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!\n" +
"You may seek him in a basement, you may look up in the air\n" +
"But I tell you once and once again Macavity's not there!\n" +
"Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin\n" +
"You'd know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in\n" +
"His brow is deeply lined IN thought, his head is highly domed\n" +
"His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed\n" +
"He sways his head from side to side with movements like a snake\n" +
"And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake\n" +
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity\n" +
"He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity\n" +
"You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square\n" +
"But when a crime's discovered then Macavity's not there!\n" +
"He's outwardly respectable, I know he cheats at cards\n" +
"And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's\n" +
"And when the larder's looted or the jewel case is rifled\n" +
"Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled\n" +
"Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair\n" +
"There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there!\n" +
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity\n" +
"There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity\n" +
"He always has an alibi and one or two to spare\n" +
"What ever time the deed took place Macavity wasn't there!\n" +
"And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known\n" +
"I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone\n" +
"Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time\n" +
"Just controls the operations, the Napolean of crime!\n" +
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity\n" +
"He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity\n" +
"You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square\n" +
"But when a crime's discovered then Macavity\n" +
